Nota notepad is the only notepad with a history. Never lose a small note, message or list again!

We have all deleted notes only to realise we need that small piece of information 2 weeks later. 
Nota allows you to go back to back in time to see notes that have been deleted.

Nota Notepad creates routine backups of your notes repeatedly through out the day.
All backups are saved and sorted by date and time. Allowing you to go back to any date.
